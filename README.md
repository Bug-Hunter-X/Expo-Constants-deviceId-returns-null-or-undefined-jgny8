# Expo Constants.deviceId Returns Null or Undefined

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's `Constants.deviceId` API where the returned value is sometimes null or undefined, even when a unique device identifier should be available.

## Bug Description

The `Constants.deviceId` API is used to obtain a unique identifier for a device.  In certain circumstances, this API returns null or undefined instead of the expected unique identifier. This inconsistency makes it unreliable for crucial tasks such as user authentication and data persistence.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app on a physical device or emulator.
4. Observe the output in the console; `Constants.deviceId` may return null or undefined.

## Workaround (See `bugSolution.js`)

The workaround involves checking for null or undefined and implementing a fallback mechanism using other device identifiers, such as generating a UUID and storing it persistently (along with a check to avoid re-generation).
